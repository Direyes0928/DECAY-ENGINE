THIS IS NOT A CLEAN AUDIO TOOL.

This is not about clarity.
This is not about fidelity.
This is not about “industry-ready” sound.

Decay Engine exists to ruin audio on purpose.

WHY DECAY?

Everything breaks.

Tape stretches.
Bits fall apart.
Signals drift.
Time degrades all things.

Modern tools fight this.
Decay Engine leans into it.

If your sound collapses, glitches, hisses, distorts, or disappears —
that is not a bug.

That is the point.

WHAT DECAY ENGINE DOES

You don’t “process” audio here.
You expose it to entropy.

Capture sound

Chop it into fragments

Degrade resolution

Introduce noise and failure

Let time mutate the signal

Save the damage as a preset

Export what survives

The engine doesn’t preserve.
It corrupts.

PHILOSOPHY

Perfection is boring.
Clean audio is disposable.
Noise has memory.

Artifacts tell a story.
Dropouts feel human.
Distortion is honest.

Decay is not loss — it’s character.

THIS ENGINE IS FOR YOU IF

You like lo-fi, grime, and unstable texture

You enjoy pushing tools past their limits

You prefer sound that feels alive

You believe mistakes are creative events

You don’t mind when things break

If you’re chasing pristine stems —
you’re in the wrong place.

THIS ENGINE IS NOT

A mastering suite

A “fix my audio” tool

A clean DAW replacement

A polished product

A safe space for sound

This is an audio demolition zone.

DESIGN RULES

Imperfection is intentional

Artifacts are features

Controls should feel physical

Mobile is not an afterthought

Presets are decay states, not settings

Stability is optional

Character is mandatory

EXPECTATIONS

Things may:

Glitch

Crackle

Drift

Fail silently

Sound worse over time

If that bothers you — stop now.

If that excites you — keep going.

STATUS

Active. Unstable. Evolving.

Decay Engine will change.
Presets will rot.
Behavior may shift.

That’s not negligence.
That’s alignment.

LICENSE

Use it.
Break it.
Remix it.
Corrupt it further.

Credit is appreciated.
Control is not enforced.

FINAL NOTE

Sound doesn’t need to be preserved forever.

Sometimes the most honest thing you can do
is let it decay.
